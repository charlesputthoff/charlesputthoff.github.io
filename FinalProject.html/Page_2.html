    <h1 align="center">More about me!</h1>
    <div class="colored-background">
    <p>I talked a little bit about me last page, but theres still more to know! I have alot of hobbies and activites that I find fun and make me happy. One that makes me really happy is the lake. I go to a lake called Pomme De Terre, means lake of the potato in French haha, and it is one of my favorite places to go because I have so many memories there and it's sort of a place to get away from the realy world. I like to do many things there such as ski, swim, tube, surf, wakeboard, ride jetskis,golf, you name it! We have a little trailer home and live about 2 miles from the lake. The area is pretty rural but I like it because you feel free from the real world. Theres bad cellphone service there so it makes the lake more enjoyable and makes you appreciate the little things and gets you away from social media for a few days which is healthy for your mental. My parent have gone there since they were kids before they even knew each other and I plan to have a lake place down there too someday if everything works out for me. I get to go there here in a couple weeks and I am so excited because going down for the first time after a long winter is a really good feeling. I also like the color blue so I made it the background of this page blue.</p>
