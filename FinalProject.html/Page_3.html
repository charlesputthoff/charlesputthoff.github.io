    <h1 align="center">My Favorite Coding</h1>
    <p>Before college, I had never really coded in highschool or anywhere else. I had maybe done it a few times on a demo website or something but nothing too serious. Also coming into Info Tech I didnt really know what to expect. I kind of chose this major because it sounded like something that I would enjoy and would be able to make a carear in. I've always thought it would be a good idea to get into something that you know will rise and become more popular and in demand in the future and technology sounded the best. I also didnt know how much coding Info Tech was before taking this course but after taking it, I like coding and problem solving with this sort of stuff. It can be frustrating at times but once I have an idea of what im doing, I really enjoy it. After a few assignments and coding prohects, I'ce had a few that I hav liked. I really enjoyed python because it was something not too complicated but was able to get the hang of the simple stuff. I hope to become more and more advanced as things go on and overtime code bigger and better things. </p>
    <p>This was one of my favorite codes to write:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            inp_lst = [6, 5, 3, 8, 4, 2, 5, 4, 11, 43, 1, 17, 27, 90, 77, 62, 51, 47, 82, 86, 20]
            numbers = len(inp_lst)
            print("The list has", numbers,"numbers")
            
            Sum = sum(inp_lst)
            print("The sum of the list is", Sum)
            
            def cal_average(num):
                sum_num = 0
                for t in num:
                    sum_num = sum_num + t           
            
                avg = sum_num / len(num)
                return avg
            
            print("The average of the list is", cal_average([6, 5, 3, 8, 4, 2, 5, 4, 11, 43, 1, 17, 27, 90, 77, 62, 51, 47, 82, 86, 20]))
            print('\v')
            print("Printing all items individually:")
            
            for x in range(len(inp_lst)):
                print(inp_lst[x])
            print('\v')
            print("List ordered in every other:")
            x = inp_lst
            def ese(a):
                   y = [ ]
                   for i in range(0,len(a),2):
                       y.append(a[i])
                   return y
            print(ese(x))
