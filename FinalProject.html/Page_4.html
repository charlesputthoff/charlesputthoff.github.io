    <h1 align="center">My Plans This Summer</h1>
    <p>Summer is always my favorite time of the year. Yes no school but for me it's mainly the weather. I'm a huge fan of the heat and I honestly think I could live out in the sun for the rest of my life. Although I know its unhealthy, I think I would enjoy it. I talked about how much the lake meant to me so I will definitely be spending alot of my times on the weekend there and getting as much sun as I can get. I plan to really learn how to wakebaord this summer and it's something I've always wanted to do, especially do a backflip off a wake. I am also lucky enough to be able to go to Mexico this summer with my family and I can't wait. I love the beach just as much as the lake and hope to have a beach house some day. I will also be spending a lot of my time working. As everyone knows, college doesnt pay itself so I will need to work a lot over the summer to help me out. I work at a pretty nice country club and want to also learn how to play golf. I alrady play a decent amount but as of right now I'm no good so I want to take lessons to hopefully get better. I am also a big fan of country music and I am fortunate enough to be able to go to Kenney Chesney Concert next saturday right after schools over in Omaha, Nebreska. I want to go to the Morgan Wallen concert in St. Louis over the summer too but tickets are too expesive. Being a big fan of country music, theres a lot of albums and songs that I really enjoy.</p>
