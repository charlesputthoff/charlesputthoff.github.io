    <h1 align="center">Where I Want To Go With My Carear</h1>
    <p>As I states earlier, I have never really thought about going into Info Tech until recently. I have always liked helping people though and want to find a way to help people through Info Tech. One carear I looked int before Info Tech was the medical field. Since I didnt go with that path, I want to be involved wit medical technolgy. It seems like It would be something up my ally and it would be a great way to do both things that I love. These are also two areas that are going to grow and or people will rely on. Billions of people use healthcare around the world and technology is a great way to help improve it. I hope I can make a difference and be really involved and help people out.</p>
        <h3>Here is a list of companies that I would be interested in working at:</h3>
<div class="colored-background">
        <ul class="my-list">  
    <li>Salvus TG</li>
    <li>Webb Technology Group, LLC</li>
    <li>Tricension</li>
    <li>Rhycom</li>
    <li>Northern Sky Technologies</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>These are all based in the Kansas City area, but if something were to come up and I were to get a job offer somewhere else out of state that is warm such as Texas, Florida, or somewhere south, I would maybe consider taking it.</p>
