    <h1 align="center">Welcome, to my Final Project!</h1>
  <p>Before we get started, let me tell you about who I am! My name is Charles Putthoff and I am from Kansas City, Missouri. I was raised in a suburb outside the city called Lees Summit and I've lived there my whole life. Growing up I've gone to private school my whole life, so this is my first year at a public school let alone a university. It has been a different but fun experience that I haved learned to enjoy. This is also my first year technololy living by myself in the dorms and although I miss my moms cooking, I havent minded it too much. I have met a lot of new life long friends and I never thought I would get along with St. Louis people like I have these last 2 semesters. But, that hasn't changed how much I still like to brag about Kansas City and how it's the greatest city in the state of Missouri, which I might do in this project because of how much pride I have growing up there. As I said in my midterm, I take a lot of pride in the barbecue in Kansas City and I feel like it's only apprpiate if I list all the best places for anyone who's visiting.</p>
